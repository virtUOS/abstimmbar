"""Rating phase of the mind-map question kind.

After collecting, the presenter switches a mind-map question to its rating
stage; participants then rate the entries instead of adding terms:

* ``points`` (dot voting): ``value`` = points on one entry (>= 1); several
  points per entry unless ``mindmap_rating_multi`` is off (then at most 1).
  Budget = the sum of a participant's points.
* ``updown``: at most one plus OR minus per entry (``value`` +1/-1). Budget =
  the number of rated entries.

Representation: the stage lives in its own row per run + question
(``MindmapPhase``), orthogonal to ``Run.phase`` — participants can only rate
while the run phase is "open" AND the stage is "rate"; closing/opening the
vote works exactly as for collecting. No row (or no rating mode) = "collect".

Hidden-until-reveal: aggregated scores are part of a payload only while the
stage is "rate" with ``mindmap_rating_live`` on, or in the results phase
(reveal; for participants additionally only when the set shows results to
participants). Otherwise the presenter only learns the number of raters.

Hidden entries (and entries below a hidden one) keep their ratings, but those
count neither towards scores/raters/ranking nor towards the participant's
budget (hiding gives the points back; unhiding may leave a participant above
the budget — ``remaining`` is then 0).

Ratings reference only the opaque participant token (anonymity by design);
tokens never leave the server. All writes run under the run lock.
